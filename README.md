# MultiAgentSystems
Brief description <- **Insert here :)**

## How to run it

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd <path_to_base_dir>
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:<path_to_base_dir>"
cd crowd_evacuation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

where <path_to_base_dir> is the path to the directory where the repository was downloaded.

## Frameworks

For this project we will use the Mesa framework. It is a modular framework for building, analyzing and visualizing agent-based models.

Its goal is to be the Python 3-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON
