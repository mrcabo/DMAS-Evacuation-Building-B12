### wo 18th sept ###

- Create agent WALL/environment/ and make a nice building (resize canvas grid size accordingly)

- The knowledge of exits will be a list of exist coordinates (one can have knowledge of one or more exits)
- Shortest path () function to the known closest exit. Try to travel diagonally so e.g. min (abs (x_(agent) - x_(exit)), abs (y_(agent) - y_(exit)))
- noisy path (going to exit maybe the entrance, but with an inconsistent direction)


- look_around() : look around in some range and get some information from the all around agents and make the decision/priority of egress based on the environment

- interact(agent_id): sharing knowledge and/or share the same behaviour (omg trust me guys, I saw an exit there!!) flock

- fire_getTheFuckOuttaHereee()  : the highest priority to run to the opposite/further way from the fire  (wtf the fire is coming here, run for my life)

- Make some fire agent (copy from example)

- Make crowd evacuation a module and instructions to run in README file (DIEGO)


### wo 25th sept ###

- Create legend of visualization to explain the components of the model (LUCIA)
- Vary the size (and color?) of agents based on their properties (LUCIA)
- Statistics (e.g. how many agents died, how many got away) dynamically on the web interface (DIEGO) - CONNECTED WITH MODEL KILL REMOVE AGENTS ETC
- Rename the repository with a meaningful name (e.g. group_name_topic) (DIEGO) - Done

- Fix the fire function to behave like (e.g. take shortest path) (SOHYUNG)
- look_around() : look around in some range and get some information from the all around agents and make the decision/priority of egress based on the environment (SOHYUNG)
- interact(agent_id): sharing knowledge and/or share the same behaviour (omg trust me guys, I saw an exit there!!) flock (ANDREAS)
- reached exit make public (ANDREAS)
- fire agent kill function (ANDREAS)
- comment out print attributes (ANDREAS)

- Initialize report with bullet points (EVERYONE)

- Use map of actual building somehow (difficult)
